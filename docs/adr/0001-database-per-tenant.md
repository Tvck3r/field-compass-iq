# ADR-0001: Database-per-Tenant Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

Field-Compass-IQ needs to support multiple enterprise customers with strict data isolation requirements, compliance needs (GDPR, CCPA), and varying performance requirements. We need to decide on the multi-tenancy strategy for data storage.

## Decision

We will implement a **database-per-tenant** architecture where each customer receives their own dedicated database instance within their own cloud project environment.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Complete data isolation**: No risk of data leakage between customers
- **Compliance friendly**: Easier to meet GDPR, CCPA, and other data sovereignty requirements
- **Customer-specific optimizations**: Can tune database performance per customer needs
- **Simplified backup and recovery**: Per-customer backup strategies
- **Easier to scale**: Can scale database resources independently per customer
- **Regional deployment**: Can deploy customer databases in specific regions for compliance

### Negative
- **Higher infrastructure costs**: Each customer requires dedicated database resources
- **Increased operational complexity**: More databases to monitor and maintain
- **Schema migration complexity**: Must run migrations across multiple databases
- **Cross-tenant analytics complexity**: Aggregated reporting across customers is more difficult

### Neutral
- **Development overhead**: Need robust tooling for database provisioning and management
- **Monitoring requirements**: Per-tenant monitoring and alerting systems needed

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Shared Database with Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Rejected: Higher risk of data leakage, compliance concerns, performance issues with large datasets

2. **Schema-per-Tenant**
   - Rejected: Still shares database resources, migration complexity, limited regional deployment options

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Shared for small customers, dedicated for enterprise)
   - Rejected: Adds complexity in data architecture and customer migration paths

## Implementation Notes

- Use Terraform modules to automate database provisioning per customer
- Implement database migration tooling that can run across multiple tenant databases
- Create per-tenant monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Develop customer onboarding automation that includes database setup
- Plan for customer data export/import capabilities for migrations
- Implement connection pooling and resource management per tenant
