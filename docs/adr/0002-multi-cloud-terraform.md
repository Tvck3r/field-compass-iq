# ADR-0002: Multi-Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

Field-Compass-IQ needs to support enterprise customers who may have existing cloud commitments, regional requirements, or specific cloud preferences. We need to design infrastructure that can deploy across multiple cloud providers while maintaining consistency and automation.

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-cloud infrastructure strategy** using Terraform modules with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the primary cloud provider, and planned support for AWS and Azure.

Primary focus: **GCP** (immediate implementation)
Planned support: **AWS** and **Azure** (future phases)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Customer flexibility**: Customers can choose their preferred cloud provider
- **Vendor lock-in mitigation**: Reduces dependency on single cloud provider
- **Regional compliance**: Can deploy in customer-preferred regions across clouds
- **Competitive advantage**: Broader market reach by supporting customer cloud preferences
- **Disaster recovery options**: Cross-cloud backup and recovery strategies

### Negative
- **Increased complexity**: Multiple cloud providers to learn, maintain, and support
- **Testing overhead**: Need to test deployments across multiple cloud environments
- **Feature parity challenges**: Different clouds have different capabilities and services
- **Increased development time**: Need to create abstraction layers for cloud-specific services

### Neutral
- **Documentation requirements**: Need comprehensive docs for each cloud deployment
- **Team expertise**: Team needs training on multiple cloud platforms
- **Cost management**: More complex cost tracking across multiple clouds

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Cloud Provider (GCP only)**
   - Rejected: Limits customer flexibility and market reach

2. **Cloud-Agnostic Kubernetes-First Approach**
   - Rejected: Loses cloud-native optimizations and managed services benefits

3. **Multi-Cloud from Day One**
   - Rejected: Too complex for MVP, decided to start with GCP and expand

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: GCP Foundation
- Create comprehensive Terraform modules for GCP
- Implement customer environment provisioning automation
- Build monitoring and alerting for GCP resources
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for GCP deployments

### Phase 2: AWS Support
- Create AWS Terraform modules with feature parity to GCP
- Implement cross-cloud monitoring dashboards
- Add AWS-specific optimizations and services

### Phase 3: Azure Support
- Create Azure Terraform modules
- Complete multi-cloud monitoring and management tooling
- Implement cross-cloud data synchronization if needed

### Technical Requirements
- **Terraform Module Structure**: Organized by cloud provider with shared common modules
- **Environment Automation**: Customer can specify cloud preference during onboarding
- **Region-Specific Deployments**: Support for data residency requirements
- **Per-Tenant Monitoring**: Cloud-agnostic monitoring with provider-specific optimizations
- **Security**: Cloud-specific security best practices and compliance standards
