# ADR-0003: CQRS with MediatR Pattern

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-06-21
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

Field-Compass-IQ requires a scalable backend architecture that can handle complex business logic, varying read/write patterns, and the need for clear separation of concerns. The application needs to support both simple CRUD operations and complex business workflows while maintaining testability and maintainability.

## Decision

We will implement **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** using the **MediatR** library in .NET, combined with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** aggregates pattern.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Commands and queries are handled separately
- **Improved testability**: Easy to unit test handlers in isolation
- **Scalability**: Can optimize read and write operations independently
- **Maintainability**: Business logic is organized in focused, single-responsibility handlers
- **Event-driven capabilities**: Natural foundation for domain events and webhooks
- **Parallel development**: Teams can work on different handlers simultaneously
- **Audit trail**: Easy to implement command logging and event sourcing

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand CQRS and DDD patterns
- **Initial complexity**: More files and structure than simple CRUD approach
- **Potential over-engineering**: Simple operations might seem complex initially
- **Performance considerations**: Additional abstraction layers may impact performance

### Neutral
- **Code generation opportunities**: Can potentially generate handlers from specifications
- **Documentation needs**: Requires clear documentation of command/query flows
- **Tooling requirements**: Need proper debugging and monitoring tools

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Repository Pattern with Services**
   - Rejected: Less clear separation of concerns, harder to test complex business logic

2. **Simple CRUD Controllers**
   - Rejected: Doesn't scale well with complex business requirements, harder to maintain

3. **Event Sourcing with CQRS**
   - Rejected for MVP: Too complex for initial implementation, can be added later

4. **Clean Architecture without CQRS**
   - Rejected: CQRS provides better scalability and testing benefits

```

### Key Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: All write operations use commands with validators
- **Query Pattern**: All read operations use queries returning DTOs
- **Aggregate Pattern**: Domain logic encapsulated in aggregates
- **Domain Events**: For triggering webhooks and cross-aggregate communication
- **Pipeline Behaviors**: For cross-cutting concerns (validation, logging, caching)

### Technical Requirements
- **MediatR**: For command/query dispatch
- **FluentValidation**: For command validation
- **AutoMapper**: For entity-to-DTO mapping
- **Domain Events**: For webhook notifications
- **Bulk Operations**: Special commands for batch processing
- **API Versioning**: Commands and queries versioned with API versions

### Standards
- All commands must have validators
- All queries must return DTOs (never domain entities)
- Commands should not return data (except IDs)
- Handlers must be focused and single-responsibility
- Use pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns
